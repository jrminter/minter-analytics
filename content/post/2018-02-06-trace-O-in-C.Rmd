# Introduction

I frequently encounter X-ray EDS analyses where there is a very intense
C peak accompanied by a small O peak. The Oxford AZtec software almost
never identifies this peak with its auto identification routine.
I wanted to understand why. Pulse-pileup artifacts are a major problem.
Two C X-rays entering the detector at the same time have an energy
just slightly higher than that of a C X-ray. In the case of my standard, one
could observe pulse-pileup effects at high count rates, yet at low
count rates the O peak appeared to be real.

# Background

In November 2014 the Probe Software Forum had a discussion of
"[Fictitious oxygen peaks in graphite](http://probesoftware.com/smf/index.php?topic=364.0)"
in the "General EDS Issues" section.

[Les Moore](https://www.linkedin.com/in/les-moore-b7566742/?ppe=1)
started the discussion with this question:

> I have noticed a fictitious oxygen peak thrown up on my EDS spectra
> on a SDD detector - I know it is fictitious as WDS says so.  It is
> most likely the doubling peak. 
>#
> The problem is, it is still quite apparent at 5% DT. I use the axiom
> that doubling peaks aren't an issue until you get up to 20-30% DT.
> If this is the case, is this an issue with the new SDD detectors - i.e.
> easy doubling at low energies?
>
> If you run the spectra through a standardless ZAF pkg, it comes up
> with 10% oxygen.

> It is not very dependent on pulse processing setup.

# My experiment (2017-09-15)

I have a Ted Pella XCS-8 EDS Calibration Standard (P/N 659-8) that has
a C standard described as "Carbon (glassy, >99.9\% Sigri Electrographit GmbH)
– to be used for light element detector testing".

I began by calibrating the energy resolution of the detector using Cu
from the standard at 20 kV.

I then dropped the microscope voltage to 5 kV and recorded "beam measurement"
spectra from the C standard at the following spot sizes, recording the probe
current on my Keithley Model 480 picoammeter.

| Spot Size | nA | live time sec |
|----------:|---:|--------------:|
| 3 | 0.10 | 3302.11 |
| 4 | 0.36 | 752.08 |
| 5 | 1.54 | 173.37 |
| 6 | 6.50 | 99.92 |

One **major difficulty** that I have is that the Oxford AZtec software
**will not export pulse-pileup corrected spectra to a .msa file** for
analysis using DTSA-II. I did two types of analyses:

## Export the raw spectra to DTSA-II and analyze

I used DTSA-II to scale the spectra to the C integral following
Dale Newbury's approach.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%',fig.cap="Input count rate series without pulse-pileup correction. **Note how the lowest two count rates precisely fit the expected energy of the C X-ray**. Note the distortion to higher energy of the spectrum from the highest two energies."}

knitr::include_graphics('/img/ICR-series.png')
```


## Overlay pile-up corrected and uncorrected spectra

I then used the Oxford software to overlay spectra with and without
pulse pile-up correction. I exported each as .png files and prepared
a montage using ImageJ.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%',fig.cap="Montage of spectra with (yellow) and without (green) pulse-pileup correction. Note that the corrected peak always looks like O even at very low count rates."}

```


## Feedback from Dale Newbury at NIST

I sent these data to Dale Newbury who responded with data from their
system. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%',fig.cap="Data from Dale Newbury (2017-09-18)."}

He made this comment on my Oxford data montage (I had told him about
the inability to export pulse-processor corrected data)
