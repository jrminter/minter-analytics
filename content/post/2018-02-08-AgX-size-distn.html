<h1>Evaluating a particle size distribution</h1>
<p>In general, most particle size distributions that I measured during my career have been best fit by a lognormal distribution. Sometimes one encounters a specimen that is better described by a normal (Gaussian) distribution. It is important to have tools that permit the analyst to scrutinize the results.</p>
<p>In this case our specimen was a dispersion of silver halide particles. These were imaged at -170C in a cooling holder to minimize radiolysis (mass loss of the halide and reduction to Ag<sup>0</sup>). This is a useful data set, so I included the measurements in my <code>rAnaLab</code> R package.</p>
<p>A representative field is shown below:</p>

<p>We can first compare the parametric statistics from both distributions. The <code>rAnaLab</code> package has a function that makes this convenient.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(rAnaLab)
data(diam)

ret &lt;- calc.normal.lognormal.stats(diam$ecd.nm)
pander::pander(ret)</code></pre>
<table style="width:61%;">

<p>Note that the mean value of the two distributions agree within about 1.5 nm. Let’s next look at a panel plot comparing the data to a normal distribution.</p>

<p>I find the panel plot particularly helpful. We only see deviations from the Normal distribution at the extreme tails.</p>
<p>We can now compare to a single mode lognormal distribution. We will first bin the data with a spacing of the 8<sup>th</sup> root of 2. Again, this has been encapsulated into two function calls. Finally, we will plot the data</p>
<pre class="r"><code>
l.b &lt;- rb.lognormal.bin(diam[,1], n.root.2=8.0,  base.val=10.0)
binned &lt;- make.log.bin.df(l.b)
plt &lt;- ggp.logx.distn(binned,
                      &quot;AgX Lognormal Grain Diameter&quot;,
                       x.units=-9,
                       d.max=0.025,
                       limits=c(50, 500),
                       breaks=c(50, 100, 500),
                       minor_breaks=c( 60, 70, 80, 90, 200, 300, 400))

print(plt)</code></pre>

<p>We don’t gain anything in this case by going to a lognormal distribution and it appears slightly skewed. We will follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam’s Razor</a> (loosely translates, “It is vain to do with more what can be done with fewer”).</p>
