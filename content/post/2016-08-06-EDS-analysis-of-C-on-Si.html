<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I frequently need to coat samples for X-ray Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) with carbon to obtain a conductive surface so that the specimen does not charge in the scanning electron microscope (SEM).</p>
<p>Especially when we run the analysis at low acceleration voltages, the carbon coating can attenuate the emitted X-rays, especially the low energy ones. I need a way to estimate the thickness of the C layer. Our vacuum evaporator does not have a thickness monitor located near the specimen. I realized that it is easy to add a small chip of conductive silicon to the sample stub prior to coating with C. I can then add an uncoated chip to the stub and measure the EDS spectrum for each.</p>
<p>I decided to write Python scripts to run Monte Carlo simulations of the spectra using the <a href="http://www.cstl.nist.gov/div837/837.02/epq/dtsa2/index.html"><strong>NIST DTSA-II Jupiter</strong></a> software and to process the data to extract the peak integrals. My plan was to use <strong>R</strong> to script the data reduction and analysis.</p>
<p>Six of the resulting spectra, after subtraction of the continuum are shown below. These were exported from DTSA-II as <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/"><strong>gnuplot</strong></a> plot files.</p>

<p>The script also computed the peak integrals, outputting the integral and an estimate of the uncertainty to a <strong>.csv</strong> file. I then used <strong>R</strong> to analyze the data (computed at 5 nm increments, even though the plots are at 20 nm increments). I computed a smooth curve using the <a href="http://research.stowers.org/mcm/efg/R/Statistics/loess.htm"><strong>LOESS</strong></a> algorithm. The predicted values may be used as a lookup table.</p>
