# Evaluating a particle size distribution

In general, most particle size distributions that I measured during my
career have been best fit by a lognormal distribution. Sometimes one
encounters a specimen that is better described by a normal (Gaussian)
distribution. It is important to have tools that permit the analyst
to scrutinize the results.

In this case our specimen was a dispersion of silver halide particles.
These were imaged at -170C in a cooling holder to minimize radiolysis
(mass loss of the halide and reduction to Ag^0^). This is a useful data
set, so I included the measurements in my `rAnaLab` R package.

A representative field is shown below:


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%',fig.cap="An image of well-dispersed AgX grains imaged at -170C."}
knitr::include_graphics('/img/AgX-img.png')
```

We can first compare the results to a normal distribution

```{r, ggplotnormal, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width='100%',fig.cap="An panel plot from well-dispersed AgX grains imaged at -170C. **Left:** Histogram and Kernel Density plot. **Center:** A boxplot highlighting outliers. **Right** A plot comparing the measured values to a Normal distribution."}

library(gridExtra)
library(ggplot2)
library(rAnaLab)
data(diam)

title <- sprintf("TEM size distribution from %d AgX grains at -170C",
                 nrow(diam))

plt <- gg.panel.plot(diam, 1, nam='ECD', un='nm',
                     lw=.75, bins=30, ti=title)

print(plt)
```

I find the panel plot particularly helpful. We only see deviations from
the Normal distribution at the extreme tails.

We can now compare to a single mode lognormal distribution. We will
first bin the data with a spacing of the 8^th^ root of 2. Again, this
has been encapsualted into two function calls. Finally, we will plot the
data

```{r, lognormDist, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width='100%',fig.cap="A plot of the data as a lognormal distribution".}

l.b <- rb.lognormal.bin(diam[,1], n.root.2=8.0,  base.val=10.0)
binned <- make.log.bin.df(l.b)
plt <- ggp.logx.distn(binned,
                      "AgX Lognormal Grain Diameter",
                       x.units=-9,
                       d.max=0.025,
                       limits=c(50, 500),
                       breaks=c(50, 100, 500),
                       minor_breaks=c( 60, 70, 80, 90, 200, 300, 400))

print(plt)
```

We don't gain anything in this case by going to a lognormal distribution and it appears slightly skewed. We will follow [Occam's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor)
(loosely translates, "It is vain to do with more what can be done with fewer").
