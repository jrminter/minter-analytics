```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE, message = FALSE)
```

[Jupyter Lab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) has been
released. In addition to Python kernels, it can also run R kernels.
Here is is how I set it up om my Macbook Pro.

1. Install Jupyter Lab using instructions from the
[Readme.md](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) file. I used

```
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
jupyter serverextension enable --py jupyterlab --sys-prefix
```

2. Install support for the R kernel. Instructions from
[Ben Chuanlong Du's Blog](http://www.legendu.net/misc/blog/install-r-kernel-for-jupyterlab/)
were very helpful.

I started with this in R:

```
# install dependencies packages of IRKernel
install.packages(c('repr', 'IRdisplay', 'crayon', 'pbdZMQ', 'devtools'))
# install IRkernel
devtools::install_github('IRkernel/IRkernel')
# register IRkernel
IRkernel::installspec() 
```

I then updated the configuration file:

```
jupyter lab --generate-config
```

3. Finally, I tested a notebook with this R code chunk, adapted
from [hrbmstr](https://twitter.com/hrbrmstr/status/966013780432965632). He appeared to be using [Ride](https://r-brain.io/en/blog/ride-a-new-data-science-ide-for-python-and-r/).

I modified his example like this. I needed to turn off warnings to
stop useless font loading warnings.

```
# Need to turn off warnings for fonts
options(warn=-1)
library(ggplot2)
library(extrafont)
library(hrbrthemes)
loadfonts(quiet=TRUE)

plt <- ggplot (mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_ipsum_rc(grid="XY")
print(plt)

options(warn=0)

```
