      <description>Evaluating a particle size distributionIn general, most particle size distributions that I measured during my career have been best fit by a lognormal distribution. Sometimes one encounters a specimen that is better described by a normal (Gaussian) distribution. It is important to have tools that permit the analyst to scrutinize the results.
In this case our specimen was a dispersion of silver halide particles. These were imaged at -170C in a cooling holder to minimize radiolysis (mass loss of the halide and reduction to Ag0).</description>
