      <description>Introduction I frequently encounter X-ray EDS analyses where there is a very intense C peak accompanied by a small O peak. The Oxford AZtec software almost never identifies this peak with its auto identification routine. I wanted to understand why. Pulse-pileup artifacts are a major problem. Two C X-rays entering the detector at the same time have an energy just slightly higher than that of a C X-ray. In the case of my standard, one could observe pulse-pileup effects at high count rates, yet at low count rates the O peak appeared to be real.</description>

      <description>Introduction I frequently need to coat samples for X-ray Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) with carbon to obtain a conductive surface so that the specimen does not charge in the scanning electron microscope (SEM).
Especially when we run the analysis at low acceleration voltages, the carbon coating can attenuate the emitted X-rays, especially the low energy ones. I need a way to estimate the thickness of the C layer. Our vacuum evaporator does not have a thickness monitor located near the specimen.</description>
